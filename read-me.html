                                <div class="card-text"> The landpage [index.html] was fully created by me without using bootstrap.
                                        That includes the Stylesheet and the JavaScript elements. The most difficult part was to make the page fully responsive,
                                        the initial design was created on web view just to realize at the end that it was a complete mess on mobile view. I used
                                        @media to implement the new solutions and I am very satisfied with the end result.

                                <div class="card-text"> Like in our second requirement, this was very easy to achieve since it occurs organically while simply developing the project.
                                        Just to make sure I made a list with the different class selectors I was sure to implement. This is list is as follows:
                                </div>
                        </div>

                                <li>tag * <em>(I applied general attributes for easier-to-understand margins and paddings)</em></li>
                                <li>tag body, header, footer</li>
                                <li>class .intro, .info, etc. <em>(page is divided into sections each with it's own class)</em></li>
                                <li>button, button:hover, button:active <em>(I wanted to implement really cool buttons!)</em></li>
                                <li>ID main-navigation <em>(the collapse button requires an unique selector.)</em></li>
                        </ol>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                        <div class="card-body">
                                <div class="card-title"><h5>"6. The website must use at least five (5) different CSS properties, such as font-size, or margin."</h5></div>
                                <div class="card-text"> The CSS properties that I used the most were those that involved the position and size of the different elements.
                                        I learned how to use a display property called flex-box, this made my life easier when it came to placing each division in their
                                        corresponding position. My top 5 list of my most used properties in this project is as follow:

                        </div>

                                <div class="card-title"><h5>"7. The website must integrate one or more features of JavaScript."</h5></div>
                                <div class="card-text"> JavaScript, while confusing at first, is really satisfying to use once you get the flow going.
                                        While I used some bootstrap JS elements, my favorite part was to create scripts of my own. In 'homepage.js' I
                                        implemented the ability to go through different pictures and texts by the press of a button (in the landpage),
                                        also in 'music.js' I implemented a script to play music by clicking on a button! (also in the landpage).
                                </div>
                        </div>

                                <div class="card-text"> This was by far the most difficult requirement for me to follow. The reason is because I started the building process the wrong way!
                                        So, lesson learned, do not ignore the mobile view while designing your website. Always toggle between all relevant views to make sure of what you are doing.
                                        Luckily, I was able to make my site functional, while the mobile view is not perfect in terms of aesthetics, it is completely functional and it shows
                                        all of the elements the right way.
